Living Post Clout: How to Escape the Context Trap

Have you noticed how it feels like we’re coming apart recently? We’ve all gotten so smart, yet all we work towards is trying to win a race to subordinate each other and earn money and clout as a totem of our success. What’s making us do this? How can we organize - at least at work - to develop both our personal aspirations and fulfilling work relationships? Because if everybody wants to singularly be on top, nobody is.
We’ve learnt that Clout is everything: Be Rich. Be popular. Be a director. Be a VP. Be a Level 9 executive. Be CEO. Be a Billionaire. Be Steve Jobs… For every context of our lives from high school to retirement, there is a new trap, with artificial goals, pecking orders, success signaling tokens and an artificial mountaintop: this is The Context Trap.
Our unquenchable desire to be above others has led us to unwittingly create unhappiness traps: the cult of being someone instead of the happiness of doing something fun together. It’s an untenable fallacy as no one “is” something: we’re multifaceted. The one who reaches the top cannot be seen if all others are head down climbing.

In Enterprises - where we spend most of our lives - the guru atop of that “cult of being” is the CEO. Most CEOs are actually pretty miserable people. They long for the lost days of building with their camarades in a garage, where one idea could turn into reality in a week. They perform like actors in their town hall meetings, a simplified persona we are meant to aspire to. Instead of honing our cunning, we devote our lives to learning the artificially arcane system that would allow us to climb the ladder towards becoming them, without realizing that this very system is a pyramid scheme unrelated to how senior management is really chosen: cunning. 
Mildly aware of this, our subconscious decides whether we adore the CEO or loathe them for fueling our illusory ambition within the trap of that system. As for the CEO themselves, when the curtain closes, they become a human again, aware of the precarity of their image, unacceptably complex and multifaceted to us, seething at the clunky slowness of the increasingly weighty beast they’re trying to guide. At their best, they give short repeated instructions, slowly turning the company right or left over years, picking shortcuts by ordering multiple departments towards an effort they could never have coordinated on their own.
However, while doing so, they hoard personal rewards (cash, better information and clout, all convertible to power) in amounts that are absurd to themselves: never able to spend it all in their lifetime, driving us to envy that absurd wealth.

Meanwhile, the single axle to convert the CEOs word into action is middle-management, universally reviled both by senior management and individual contributors. The middle manager-managee relationship is so oddly performative. Imagine that: You have another human being in charge of you. Their mood, their unconscious bias are in charge of your income and worse your perception by others. This is particularly bad knowing middle-managers are plagued by the curse of ratio metrics like ROI and IRR. Clay Christensen described how Japan went from being an epicenter of innovation to producing mostly nothing of note over many decades when analysts began to obsess over the short-sightedness of these metrics. This has come to the US: we don’t see centers of innovation like Xerox Park or Bell Labs. Instead, the corporate playbook resembles the operating manual of a washing machine:

New middle-manager comes in.
They translate the CEO’s word into a Product Strategy for their area.
They trigger a reOrg because the various teams weren’t organized to serve their Product Strategy.
They run immensely painful Prioritization ceremonies to order the few oversubscribed Platform teams who don’t just serve the Product strategy but serve everyone, making self-execution impossible.
At best, Individual contributors delegate their agency and therefore happiness to that process. At worst, they work against it, discontent that their personal convictions and ideas can’t be heard.
Finally, if middle-managers 
aim towards something big and ambitious, they are much more unlikely to convince the many teams involved. So they miss their ROI in 6 months and disappear. Go back to Step 1, rinse, wash, repeat
aim towards something small enough, they are promoted and hire someone to do it again for them. Go back to Step 1, rinse, wash, repeat

In all scenarios, innovation ceases proportionally to the size and age of the company yet a case is always made to grow and reOrganize constantly. CEOs become cultish icons whose stares are to be avoided. As we grow smarter, individual contributors and managers are more and more at each other's throat, making us all feel more unraveled. We become more and more performative at work separating our authentic creative and innovative selves from the subordinated personas we present. We become obsessed over collecting more clout within the context we’re currently trapped in. We work more, yet produce less and miss a sense of meaning for our lives, unhappier the more our subconscious understands it’s happening.

So how do we solve this?
First, we need to define what is Happiness, our true goal. Happiness is Play. Humans are social animals and invariably, if you ask anyone what was their best time at work, it’s usually early in their career working with a small group of friends at work who were absolutely vibing. Just like when we were children playing with others: happiness is encouraging individuals to be creative, debating constructively and therefore gaining a stake, yet selflessly committing to deliver your friends’ ideas as if they were yours, and vice-versa.

Our entrepreneurial and creative ideals have outgrown the militarist idea of management and subordination. Yet we know democracies and communist ideals fail even harder at work. But why should we think these are the only two extremes available? It’s okay to want to grow society around us while expecting to also grow personally and exert some level of control proportional to our cunning. But it’s probably unhealthy to set the goal of hoarding such huge quantities of resources that we would never be able to use them, just to demonstrate our supremacy and control everything solely because we made a handful of good decisions in the past. So what’s the middleground?

What if we thought of work as investing into each other rather than seeking personal clout?

Let’s imagine a Post Clout company where we invest in each others

Jane is the CEO of an EV car company, her thesis is that in-vehicle software margins are better than the margins you get when selling the vehicle, so she wants investments in cool software toys for drivers.
Laura is the SVP in charge of the infotainment system in the vehicle. Her investment thesis is that EV vehicle infotainment will make or break a car company particularly when the car is parked and charging. She has ideas of her own but is also calling in “funded” ideas from individuals.

Seeing this, Kate puts an investment thesis on the company’s investment funding board, here’s what it looks like:
Short “What”: Let’s integrate a Playstation on the main screen (that only works when the car is parked)
Short “Why”: People will love it and pay for it when stuck for a 1h recharge on a road trip.
Success is defined as: 
Splendidly: $1B yearly revenue (10x success)
Ok: $100M yearly revenue (1x success)
Fail: Less than $1M yearly revenue (0x success)
Project is taking bids for:
50 front end engineers (5 teams of 9 with 1 investment manager each)
Team UI rendering (9 back end engineers and 1 investment manager)
Team game controllers (9 back end engineers and 1 investment manager)
…
50 back end engineers (5 teams of 9 with 1 investment manager each)
10 Product Managers (...)
10 UX designers 
5 UX researchers
5 Project Managers
Bid modifiers are: 50% for expertise and 50% for prior team work

Clara is a software engineer and wants to tackle connecting the game controllers connecting to the car with 5 of her friends. So she convinces them to make a bid as a team. They think they can do it in a year’s time and they decide that’s an investment of $500k for each of their time. That’s what they each bid. But because of their back end expertise and the fact that they’ve worked as a team together before, they get two 50% bonuses. That means they’re bidding each $1M of their time. So, if the overall launch of Playstation on the main screen is:

A splendid success with $1B of revenue, they will get $10M each.
An okay success with $100M revenue, they will get $1M each
A failure with less than $100k, they get $0. Note that they all have a social safety net from the company and get the minimum to pay for housing and food in their area as a salary from the company.

And all these rewards are analog, so if they only get to $50M revenue in year 1, they still get $500k of return on investment. 

The overall benefit here is that people don’t act as subordinates for creative and entrepreneurial risk, often dragged along unwillingly, they act as investors. They decide to take on what they believe in. They work more and more with teams who gel making work into play. The washing cycle of reOrgs is not necessary as teams form and reform for ideas. People will say that it’s really dangerous to let the staff choose the idea they invest in but that’s not what’s happening here as the staff really only rejects upfront ideas by not bidding on them which is a lot better than doing it insidiously over years of working half-heartedly on projects they don’t believe in.
The most challenging part may be that CEOs and senior managers can’t hoard billions in this model anymore as more wealth is spread towards each successful investor in the system. But isn’t that a feature rather than a bug, not because wealth is bad, but because hoarding so much wealth that it cannot be spent is just an inefficient and eventually self-destructive way to affirm one’s ego. Instead of aspiring to be a billionaire, we’ll all have to aspire to doing fun things together, finding teams who love and accept us with our multi-faceted quirks instead of displaying our wealth, power and clout as a status symbol no one really cares about in the long run anyway.
