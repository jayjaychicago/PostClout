An investment thesis has to have:

Short “What”: 140 characters max. E.g. Let’s integrate a Playstation on the main screen (that only works when the car is parked)
Short “Why”: 140 characters max. People will love it and pay for it when stuck for a 1h recharge on a road trip.
Success Definition as a single metric and order of magnitude for that metric change at 3 levels (splendid, ok, fail): E.g.
    Splendidly: $1B yearly revenue (10x success)
    Ok: $100M yearly revenue (1x success)
    Fail: Less than $1M yearly revenue (0x success)
